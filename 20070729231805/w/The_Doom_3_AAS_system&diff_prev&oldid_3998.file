<a name="Doom_3_AAS"></a><h1> Doom 3 AAS </h1>
<a name="Disclaimer"></a><h2> Disclaimer </h2>
<p>The original intent of me writing all this down was to learn about the AAS system. Doom 3 is my first game programming experience and there is a lot to learn. I have found that writing it down as I go forces me to think through it in a way I normally wouldn’t. I hope it can be of use to someone and apologize for the poor organization and rough writing that follows. I will be spending more time on this completing the areas that are missing and formatting all the code to look good up here over the next few weeks.
</p>
<a name="Credits"></a><h2> Credits </h2>
<p>This entire thing is the result of me trying to understand the Area Awareness System system designed by J.M.P. van Waveren. His <a href="/web/20070729231805/http://modwiki.net/wiki/Mr_elusive%27s_thesis" title="Mr elusive's thesis">thesis paper</a> was invaluable in this process. Basically, all I did below is combine chapter 6 of the thesis with the doom 3 code. Credit goes out to him and all of id software for the kick ass games and sdk’s. Thanks JP for all the help and advice with the AAS stuff.
</p>
<a name="Overview"></a><h2> Overview </h2>
<p><i>“The Area Awareness System (AAS) is the whole system used to provide the bot with all the information about the current state of the world. This includes information about navigation, routing and also other entities in the game. All the information is formatted and preprocessed for fast and easy access and usage by the bot. The heart of AAS is a special 3D representation of the game world. All information provided to the bot is in
some way related to or linked with this 3D representation‿
</p><p>AAS uses 3D bounded hulls, called areas, with a specific property: the navigational complexity for traveling from any reachable point in an area to any other reachable point in the same area is minimal. … this means a player can move between any such two points by just walking or swimming along a straight line.
</p><p>Of course only knowing this property of each area does not provide all the information required for routing and navigation. However, so called reachabilities between areas can be calculated. Such a reachability is created from one area to another if a player can easily travel from one area to the other. Calculating these reachabilities is not all that difficult because a lot of areas will touch each other. When two areas touch, it can easily be verified if a player can really travel from one area to the other. This does not cover all the possible reachabilities between areas, but as will be shown later on, calculating other reachabilities is sometimes more complex, but definitely possible.
</p><p>The system, as it is presented here, is primarily focused on navigation and routing. However a lot of other information can be retrieved from or linked to this 3D representation.
</i>
</p>
<a name="Creating_Areas"></a><h2> Creating Areas </h2>
<p><i>
‿All primitives used for collision… can now be expanded. All the space outside these expanded solid brushes is the space, where players can move around i.e. where the origin of the player bounding box can be. At this point convex hulls can be defined within this space. Within these convex hulls the player will be able to move with minimal navigational complexity. These convex hulls will become the areas of AAS‿
.</i>
</p><p>We should look at how an area is represented in code. A file that one needs to understand well if one wants to dig into doom 3 AAS is AASFile.h. Pop it open and look for this:
</p>

	<span style="color: #0000ff;">short</span> clusterAreaNum;			<span style="color: #339900;">// number of the area in the cluster</span>

	idReachability *	rev_reach; 	<span style="color: #339900;">// reachabilities that lead to this area</span>
<span style="color: #000000;">&#125;</span> aasArea_t;</pre>
<p>An area is a convex space defined by the faces that bound it. An area keeps track of how many faces it has bounding it and the index of its first face. The actual faces are shared between areas and are stored independent of the area itself. 
</p><p>Areas keep track of what cluster they belong to by storing the index of that cluster. We will get into clusters and what they are soon.  
</p><p>Areas can be tagged with travel flags to indicate which type of travel is necessary to cross the area. Must one fly, walk, swim, etc. Travel flags are used to indicate what type of travel an AI entity can use. The flags are also declared in AASFile.h.
</p>

<p>We will look at how these travel flags are compared by the routing system later.
</p><p>Areas store a pointer to the first “reachability‿ in a list that is all reachabilities that lead from the area they represent to other surrounding areas. Areas also store a list of the reachabilities that lead to the area from other areas. these are stored in reach and rev_reach. idReachability details are also coming up soon.
</p>
<a name="Contents_of_volumes"></a><h3> Contents of volumes </h3>
<p><i>“… the contents of certain volumes is also defined with brushes. For instance a water volume is defined with a special brush. The same goes for lava and slime. These brushes that define a contents can also be expanded and compiled into the BSP tree. The leaf nodes that only contain (parts of) these brushes, that define content, can be marked as volumes with that content.</i>
</p><p>Areas can be flagged as having contents or attributes. These flags can mean just about anything you want. The flags are used by the goal and routing algorithms. They are stored in the flags member and use bit masks to do their work. Here they are, also from idAASFile.h:

<pre>&nbsp;
<span style="color: #339900;">// area flags</span>
<span style="color: #339900;">#define AREA_FLOOR			BIT(0)		// AI can stand on the floor in this area</span>
<span style="color: #339900;">#define AREA_GAP			BIT(1)		// area has a gap								</span>
<span style="color: #339900;">#define AREA_LEDGE			BIT(2)		// if entered the AI bbox partly floats above a ledge</span>
<span style="color: #339900;">#define AREA_LADDER			BIT(3)		// area contains one or more ladder faces</span>
<span style="color: #339900;">#define AREA_LIQUID			BIT(4)		// area contains a liquid	</span>

<a name="Portalisation"></a><h3> Portalisation </h3>
<p><i>‿In order to calculate reachabilities and routes between areas (as will be done later on), another representation is required for the convex hulls (areas). The BSP tree does store all the information needed, but the representation cannot easily be used to calculate relations between areas. A representation with areas that are bounded by faces would be much more suitable. These faces are polygons that either represent solid walls or lead to other areas. With such a representation adjacency of areas can easily be determined, and it is easier to find or calculate geometric properties. Such a representation can be created by portalising the BSP tree. This technique creates portals between all the leaf nodes defined by the BSP tree. These portals are the faces
that bound the areas‿</i>

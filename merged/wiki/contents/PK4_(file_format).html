  Ideally, every asset used by the idTech 4 engine is stored in a .PK4 file (also known as a "pack" or "pak" file). Pack files are just normal
  <a href="ZIP_%28file_format%29" title="ZIP (file format)">
   .ZIP
  </a>
  files with the .PK4 extension - you can use
  <a class="external text" href="http://www.win-rar.com/" title="http://www.win-rar.com">
   WinRar
  </a>
  ,
  <a class="external text" href="http://www.winzip.com/" title="http://www.winzip.com">
   Winzip
  </a>
  ,
  <a class="external text" href="http://www.7-zip.org/" title="http://www.7-zip.org/">

  or a similar utility to browse or create new .PK4 files. An even easier alternative might be
  <a href="Pk4scape" title="Pk4scape">
   Pk4scape
  </a>
  , which handles all things for the user.

     The PK4 files used in the single player component have a modified header which prevents them from being opened by a standard archive program with the exception of WinRar which seems capable of "repairing" these files.

  If you have more than one pack file or assets in a mix of pack files and individual files here is the expected behavior of the engine:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Assets inside pack files that come later in alphabetical order override assets with the same name in Pack files that come earlier.
  </li>
  <li>
   Assets as individual files override assets inside pack files.
  </li>
  <li>
   Assets in pack files or modfolders override assets with the same name in the base folder
  </li>
 </ol>

  Compression

 <p>
  As renamed .ZIP files, .PK4 can have compressed files inside but also uncompressed ones by using the
  <i>
   store
  </i>
  option in the .ZIP format. The pack files that come with Doom 3 and the Doom 3: Resurrection of Evil expansion feature compression. Although compressed pack files increase loading times, this penalty is small while the filesize difference is significant: Doom 3's assets are 3.6Gb uncompressed, and only 1.44Gb in their original .PK4 form.

 <h4>
  Achieving Better Compression For Distribution
 </h4>
 <p>
  Even if you use the maximum compression possible in .PK4 files it will never rival the compression ratios possible by
  <a class="external text" href="http://www.win-rar.com/" title="http://www.win-rar.com">
   WinRar
  </a>
  for instance. However the following will:
 </p>
 <ol>
  <li>
   Create your .PK4 files with the
   <i>
    store
   </i>
   compression factor.
  </li>
  <li>
   RAR all your .PK4 files with maximum compression. (You may want to create a SFX archive, instead of straight .RAR so people won't have to download WinRar to open it; which can also double as an installer for your mod.)
  </li>
 </ol>
 <p>
  You should now be able to distribute a much smaller file than if you had used max compression for the .PK4 files. However, once installed your files will be as large as if not in a .PK4 file because they are uncompressed thanks to the
  <i>
   store
  </i>
  option.

 <p>
  On a side note:
  <a class="external text" href="http://www.7-zip.org/" title="http://www.7-zip.org/">

  s compression ratio is even better, but not as wide-spread as the WinRar format.

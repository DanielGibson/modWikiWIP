 <p>
  Model declarations define a model reference that associates a mesh, it's animations, and any additional settings with a given name so that they can be referenced as a group. This can prove useful. For instance, allowing you to reuse animations with different models provided they share the same skeleton.
 </p>
 <p>
  It's generally used with animated models although there doesn't appear to be any indication that you couldn't use them with a static model as well.

  Model declarations begin with a header which consists of the keyword "model" followed by the name of the model.
 </p>
 <p>
  The header is followed by the body of the declaration which is enclosed in curly brackets.
 </p>
 <p>
  The body is composed of a series of keywords and their parameters.

 <h2>
  Frame Commands
 </h2>
 <p>
  Through the use of the anim keyword, it is possible to trigger events on a per frame basis. This is accomplished by opening a new set of curly brackets as outlined in the syntax section.
 </p>
 <p>
  Within this unique set of curly brackets you can issue commands on a per frame basis. This allows you to play footstep sounds in sequence with a walking animation, throw fireballs in sequence with a throwing animation, ect...
 </p>
 <p>
  To further elaborate on the proper syntax...

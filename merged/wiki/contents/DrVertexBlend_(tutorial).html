   Vertex Painted ASE Models with DarkRadiant and Blender 2.53
  </h1>
  <p>
   For the level designer who is not comfortable in a modeling package I've written a series of ASE import and export plugins so that you might benefit from vertex blending or coloring in your maps.
  </p>
  <p>
   These plugins will not absolve you of a modeling application completely however they will spare you from modeling and uv mapping. Essentially the entire process has been reduced to four steps.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    Export map geometry from DarkRadiant
   </li>
   <li>
    Import resulting .ASE into Blender
   </li>
   <li>
    Switch to vertex paint mode and paint
   </li>
   <li>
    Export object(s) from Blender
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   It is assumed you already have DarkRadiant 1.4 and Blender 2.53 installed.

   Also it should be mentioned that at the time of this writing, The Dark Mod does not appear to come with many if any vertex blended or vertex colored material shaders. If you intend to use such a material, you'll need to use one from Doom 3 or create a new one before you reach this step.

   If you don't know how to create such a material you'll find a brief description of the process in Appendix B at the end of this document.

   Assuming you have DarkRadiant open, you have created or loaded the map geometry you intend to export, and vertex blended or colored material shaders are applied to your satisfaction, perform the following steps.

   If import was successful familiar geometry should appear in the main viewport and be reflected in the outliner. Take care that if you were to switch to textured mode, no texture would appear on the model. But rest assured that the material shaders applied in DarkRadiant have been preserved.

  </p>
  <p>
   The reason for this is because a material shader as used in the idTech 4 engine is not an image as Blender expects all textures to be. Instead, it is a declaration which references several images along side other game assets. Take note that in the image below, the texture panel is making reference to a non-existant image texture. This reference "textures/rock/newdarkrockblend" does not represent a file named newdarkrockblend in a folder called textures/rock. This is in fact the full name of a material shader.

  <p>
   While it is theoretically possible to give the script the ability to read the contents of .pk4 files, load the contents of .mtr files, identify the specified material shader, and extract/convert the required image files so that they may be loaded into Blender, it is not required for vertex painting.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the future such functionality may be incoorporated into the script but as it stands, it is not too much to ask that you refrain from playing with texture settings within Blender unless you know what you are doing.
  </p>
  <p>
   It is important to note that brushes with multiple textures are exported as separate objects within a single .ASE file. Although the .ASE format supports unique textures per-face, idTech 4 does not so spliting faces into separate objects is required.
  </p>
  <p>
   If there were any problems during import or it appears parts of the model are missing, check the console which would be the DOS or BASH terminal running in the background for error messages. If you encounter a problem please share the full contents of the console and the .ASE so that I can fix it.

   Vertex blending is when two textures are blended based on the color of the underlying vertices. idTech 4 dictates that you use white to represent one texture and black to represent the other. Gray values are used to gradually blend between the two.
  </p>
  <p>
   Vertex coloring is when one texture is tinted based on the color of the underlying vertices. You are not restricted in color usage although I am hard pressed to find a use for this. Technically you could paint shadows and the like on a mesh provided the geometry was dense enough.

   Appendix A. Preparing a Native Object for Export
  </h1>
  <p>
   If you've created objects within Blender, it is not enough to simply export them as you would with something you've imported from DarkRadiant.
  </p>
  <p>
   The distinction is in the fact that brushes and patches exported to .ase from DarkRadiant are already UV mapped and have a material applied while objects created within Blender do not.
  </p>

  <h3>
   UV Mapping

   </p>
  </p>
  <p>
   UV mapping is best explained through an analogy. Imagine you have a box and you want to lay it flat and run it through your printer to apply a texture to it. Obviously the box isn't going to lay flat unless you pull it apart at the seams.
  </p>
  <p>
   UV mapping is the process of marking the seams on your object and commanding Blender to unwrap it. Once an object has been UV mapped, you've essentially given Blender and more importantly idTech 4 instructions on where parts of a 2D texture should appear on the 3D model.
  </p>
  <p>
   For the purposes of this section the example object will be a cube.

   At this point the object should be ready for export. If you have multiple objects you'd like to export as an .ASE you'll need to uv map and apply a material to them separately.

   Appendix B. Preparing Vertex Blended or Colored Material Shaders
  </h1>
  <p>
   Generally this is a matter of opening up one or multiple material shader(s), mixing and matching portions of them, making a few modifications, and saving the newly created material shader with a unique name.
  </p>
  <p>
   In section four I outlined the difference between vertex blended and vertex colored material shaders. I'm going to assume you've grasped the concept and know which of the two you're after.
  </p>
  <p>
   It would also be of great benefit if you studied the texturing documentation available here along with a few existing materials that make use of vertex colors like textures/rock/dirt03_sharprock3.

 <p>
  Animates an item property from one value to another. This is equivalent to what's usually called an 'easing' or 'tweening' animation somewhere else. It works a lot like the
  <a href="Set_%28GUI_command%29" title="Set (GUI command)">
   set
  </a>
  command, except that it interpolates the values in-between during a certain time to create smooth visual transitions.

 <pre>transition <i>property</i> <i>oldValue</i> <i>newValue</i> <i>time</i> [<i>start_inertia</i> <i>stop_force</i>]
</pre>
 <p>
  <i>
   property
  </i>
  is the name of a property in the current item, or a reference to a property on another item (through the "itemName::propertyName" syntax).
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   oldValue
  </i>
  is the actual or starting value on the animation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   newValue
  </i>
  is the future or desired value on the animation.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   time
  </i>
  is the time, in miliseconds, that the transition will take. The transition begins as soon as the command is called, and lasts for the time declared here.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   start_inertia
  </i>
  is the starting inertia for the value change. It defaults to 0 and it means a direct, linear starting animation; the maximum seems to be 1 and that means it starts slowly and then accelerates.
 </p>
 <p>
  <i>
   stop_force
  </i>
  is the stopping force for the change value. It defaults to 0 and that means a direct, linear ending animation; the maximum seems to be 1 and that means it slowly deaccelerates to a complete stop.

  The Area Awareness System is the navigation system that the AI uses.
 </p>
 <p>
  An AAS map is a simplified 3D map of the level compiled from the solid
  <a href="Brush" title="Brush">
   brush
  </a>
  work in the .map file.
Areas are the most simplified volume so navigation within an
  <a href="Area" title="Area">
   Area
  </a>
  is simple point to point.
  <a class="new" href="Reachabilities" title="Reachabilities">
   Reachabilities
  </a>
  between Areas are then calculated.
 </p>
 <p>
  Brushes with the material monster clip (a misnomer since it only clips the aas map, which isn't used for collision) are also read by the ass compiler.
 </p>
 <p>
  As noted the aas compiler works on brushes, and ignores models an patches. There is an exception with patch support being a command line option, however with the common usage of using patches for decals it is not an efficient option.

  One of the most useful cvars for debugging AAS maps is:
  <a href="Aas_showAreas_%28cvar%29" title="Aas showAreas (cvar)">
   Aas_showAreas
  </a>
 </p>
 <p>
  The aas compiler can be invoked with the
  <a class="new" href="RunAAS_%28console_command%29" title="RunAAS (console command)">
   runAAS (console command)
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  The aas compiler works by looking for "use_aas" keys on map entities to read the aas type. It creates a different aas map per aas type.
It then flood fills from those entities, using the bounding size in the setting. For example: in Doom 3 the common sizes are aas48 - 48x48x82 for humanoid sized monsters and aas96 - 96x96x96 for larger, with very large boss monsters getting their own type.

  In ETQW there are two types, one for players and another for vehicles.

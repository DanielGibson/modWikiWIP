  This turns the entire surface into a mirror (see also the
  <a href="MirrorRenderMap_%28Material_stage_keyword%29" title="MirrorRenderMap (Material stage keyword)">

  stage keyword). Mirrors have certain limitations; the following situations can provoke visual artefacts:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   They act as portals which mean they cannot be broken by any other surfaces whose materials have the

   Two mirror surfaces which are within line of sight with each other.

 <p>
  In the image to the right, two visportals divide the space into three areas. Because of this, the space with the mirror is independant from the area behind it and thus the mirror renders correctly.

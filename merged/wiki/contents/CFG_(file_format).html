 <p>
  The CFG files are ASCII text configuration files present in /
  <a href="Base_%28folder%29" title="Base (folder)">
   base
  </a>
  and used by id tech 4 based games for setting
  <a href="Console" title="Console">
   CVars
  </a>
  , mapping player input to keys or buttons (see note below), and executing console commands. Usually the following files are available (by reading order of the engine):
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <i>
    DoomConfig.cfg
   </i>
   - Stores all the game's options. It's auto-generated by the engine so manual editing is not recommended. If you delete this file the engine will revert to a
   <i>
    default.cfg
   </i>
   file located inside one of the .
   <a href="PK4_%28file_format%29" title="PK4 (file format)">
    PK4
   </a>
   files.
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    editor.cfg
   </i>
   - Optional. Stores all the
   <a href="DoomEdit" title="DoomEdit">
    DoomEdit
   </a>
   relevant options. It's auto-generated by the engine so manual editing is not recommended.
  </li>
  <li>
   <i>
    autoexec.cfg
   </i>
   - Optional. This file is read last and will override any options set elsewhere. It's meant for user-manipulation so you can set any CVars here that you'd have to otherwise set in the game or editor shortcuts.
  </li>
 </ul>
 <p>
  You can also create your own custom configuration files to load custom settings and execute console commands in notepad. You can then load these files by using the
  <a href="Exec_%28console_command%29" title="Exec (console command)">
   exec
  </a>
  console command in the shortcut or adding the following line to your
  <i>
   autoexec.cfg
  </i>
  :
 </p>
 <pre>exec myconfig.cfg
</pre>
 <p>
  You can use two forward slashes to write comments:
 </p>
 <pre><span style="color: #339900;">// This is a comment</span></pre>
 <p>

   Note:
  </b>
  Mapping player input is accomplished through the use of the
  <a href="Bind_%28console_command%29" title="Bind (console command)">
   bind
  </a>
  console command which accepts
  <a href="Console" title="Console">
   console commands
  </a>
  ,
  <a href="Console" title="Console">
   cvars
  </a>
  , and
  <a href="Impulse" title="Impulse">
   impluses
  </a>
  as valid input.

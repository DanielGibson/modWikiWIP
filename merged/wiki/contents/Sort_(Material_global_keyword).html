  Description
 </h2>
 <p>
  Changes the "screen layer" a material is drawn in. This global keyword is mainly used to correct issues with transparent materials.
 </p>
 <p>
  Such issues become clear when one material furthest away from the viewer is still drawn on top of a transparent material which is closer in distance. Modifying the sorting order resolves this by changing the order in which materials are drawn on the screen.

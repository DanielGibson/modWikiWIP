  Discrete surfaces will not be clipped to the world, and it is suggested that this keyword is used in surfaces like
  <a href="GUIs" title="GUIs">
   GUIs
  </a>
  or mirrors. Surfaces with this option can be used to facilitate
  <a href="Brush_carving" title="Brush carving">
   brush carving
  </a>
  , by allowing manually-split brushes to remain separate after compilation, although extensive use of this keyword may lead to a suboptimal number of polygons in the map.

  <h2>
   Requirements
  </h2>
  <p>
   Despite the fact that Quake 4 runs on other platforms, QuakeEdit requires Windows 2000/XP. It's recommended that QuakeEdit is run on machines with better performance than the minimum system requirements of the game unless you only want to edit small maps and that you have a three-button mouse. A suggested minimum system specification for editing maps would be:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    2Ghz CPU or equivalent
   </li>
   <li>
    768mb RAM
   </li>
   <li>
    A video card capable of displaying

  <h2>
   Troubleshooting
  </h2>
  <p>
   This section describes bugs or peculiar behaviour of QuakeEdit and any known solutions. If you find a bug not covered here you might try quitting the editor, deleting the
   <a href="CFG_%28file_format%29" title="CFG (file format)">
    editor.cfg
   </a>
   file present in the /
   <a href="Q4base_%28folder%29" title="Q4base (folder)">
    q4base (folder)
   </a>
   folder and restarting the editor. This will revert the editor to its defaults. If you have a problem with the toolbar and this doesn't fix your problem try also deleting the "toolsx86.ini" file in your windows directory.

  </a>
  <h3>
   There are many black textures in the texture browser
  </h3>
  <p>
   Quake 4 comes with a lot of redundant, nonfunctional material shaders. The problem is that the declarations reference image files that were not shipped with the game.
  </p>
  <p>
   At present no level editor, including the built in editor, validates each shader to ensure the images exist. This results in a texture browser where half the textures listed are of no use.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the case of Doom 3, there is a workaround and the same solution could be applied to other games. Check

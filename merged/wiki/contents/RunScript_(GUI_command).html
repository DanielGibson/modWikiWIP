  defined by the user. This is the real way to extend the GUI functionality: while you can create all kinds of fancy graphics on the GUI, it can't do much feature-wise.

  Notice that a script can also be called using the

  command with
  <i>
   cmd
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   runscript
  </i>
  parameters. id Software used this a lot on their code, as it allows you to call specific functions within scripts.

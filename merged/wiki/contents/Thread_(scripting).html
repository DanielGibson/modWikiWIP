  A script thread is the line of execution managed by the
  <a href="Coding#Game_code" title="Coding">
   game code
  </a>
  by the
  <a href="Game_class" title="Game class">
   game class
  </a>
  idThread.
 </p>
 <p>
  It is typically created for a script function call from game code and deleted when that function exits.
 </p>
 <p>
  A new thread is created when calling a function from within script via an entity reference to execute that function.
 </p>
 <p>
  When an entity spawns with a script object set it will create a thread to execute the init() function.

  manage a thread for the current set state, running it each frame.

 <p>
  The
  <b>
   sys
  </b>
  identifier is used within a script to call events defined on the
  <a href="Game_class" title="Game class">
   game class
  </a>
  idThread, they are called on the idThread instance that is executing that part of the script. See System Events for respective game:
  <a href="Script_events" title="Script events">
   Script events
  </a>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  Threads can be created from within a script itself by using the
  <b>
   thread
  </b>
  identifier. There are also several events for managing threads from within script. See
  <a href="Scripting_basics#Threads" title="Scripting basics">

 <p>
  Since threads are part of normal
  <a href="Coding#Game_code" title="Coding">
   game
  </a>
  execution, script authors using threads (including
  <a href="Script_object" title="Script object">
   script objects
  </a>
  ) to set up run time behavior must take note of letting threads execute for a long time without letting threads wait. Essentially letting the overall game execution continue.
 </p>
 <p>
  Waiting suspends execution on the thread until the specified time.
 </p>
 <p>
  While there is infinite loop protection, and a limit on events per frame, there may be other cases it won't catch and run time behavior should be planned accordingly.

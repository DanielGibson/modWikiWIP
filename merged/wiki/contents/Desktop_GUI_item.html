   The
   <i>
    Desktop
   </i>
   is the main
   <a href="GUI_items" title="GUI items">
    item
   </a>
   that makes a
   <a href="GUIs" title="GUIs">
    GUI
   </a>
   . As the first item, it contains all other items nested on it, as well as some special
   <a href="GUI_item_events" title="GUI item events">
    GUI item events
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   The desktop GUI is a
   <a href="WindowDef_%28GUI_item_type%29" title="WindowDef (GUI item type)">
    windowDef
   </a>
   item and follows the same syntax of other items, with a few reservations. For example:
  </p>
  <pre>windowDef Desktop { 
	rect		0, 0, 640, 480 
	backcolor	0, 0, 0, 1
	...
}
</pre>
  <p>
   You will notice its size (used on the
   <a href="Rect_%28GUI_item_property%29" title="Rect (GUI item property)">
    rect
   </a>
   property) is defined as 640x480. This does not mean this GUI is restricted for this resolution! Instead, it means it takes the full screen in any other resolution, as the
   <a href="GUIs" title="GUIs">
    GUI
   </a>
   system uses these values as a basis for the screen coordinates. In the end, this makes no difference at all; you just have to remember to design your GUI screens based on a similar resolution, or calculate the equivalents when translating your coordinates to the GUI script code.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is akin to what other games use. For example, the Unreal Tournament engine uses a maximum screen size of 1x1. In the end, they mean the same thing, but just uses different powers for parameters.

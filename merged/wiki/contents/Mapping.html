   Mapping for
   <a href="Id_Tech_4" title="Id Tech 4">
    id Tech 4
   </a>
   games is based on 'additive' editing, whereby the level designer adds solid geometry to an empty "world", know as the
   <b>
    void
   </b>
   in Doom 3. This is contrasted with "subtractive" editing which is used in Unreal and its derivatives - in these games the world starts out solid and rooms are subtracted from it, with extra details such as pillars being added back.
  </p>
  <p>
   Users of Unreal-based engines may initially find Doom 3 editing overly complex: instead of subtracting a simple room, it is necessary to create solid brushes for floor, ceiling and walls and make sure they do not leave any gaps. However, pure-additive geometry is simpler from the engine's perspective (since the order of brush creation is no longer critical), and completely eliminates the "BSP holes" that plague Unreal levels.

  <h2>
   Components of a map
  </h2>
  <p>
   Any map will contain a number of standard elements, which are discussed below.
  </p>
  <a name="Brushes">
  </a>
  <h3>
   Brushes
  </h3>
  <p>
   <a href="Brush" title="Brush">
    Brushes
   </a>
   are convex solids that form the basic geometry of a map - floors, ceilings, walls, and basic internal solids (such as steps or beams) that do not require a model are produced with brushes. At the very least, the outer hull of a map must be made from brushes since by default, they belong to the only
   <a href="Entity" title="Entity">
    entity
   </a>
   class (the worldspawn) capable of sealing the map from the void.
  </p>
  <p>
   Aside from visual geometry, brushes can also be used to define volumes within a map with unique properties. This is done by applying
   <a href="Special_Volume_Materials" title="Special Volume Materials">
    special volume materials
   </a>
   (a.k.a. "common" materials) to their surface. An example would be the material
   <i>
    player_clip
   </i>
   which prevents the player from entering the designated volume.
  </p>
  <p>
   If a user attempts to create a concave brush through a
   <a href="CSG" title="CSG">
    CSG
   </a>
   operation, the editor automatically fragments it to create a number of smaller convex brushes that combine to create the desired concave structure.
  </p>
  <a name="Entities">
  </a>
  <h3>
   Entities
  </h3>
  <p>
   <a href="Entity" title="Entity">
    Entities
   </a>
   are functional objects placed in a map ("actors" to the Unreal mappers).
   <a href="Light" title="Light">
    Lights
   </a>
   , monsters, items, doors - anything which must do something as opposed to just constituting map geometry - are all examples of entities. Entities can be created in-editor from patches or brushes, while pre-defined entities can be added from the right-click context menu in the main editor window. Entities are inherently dynamic and can be controlled either by the
   <a href="Coding" title="Coding">
    game logic
   </a>
   or level
   <a href="Scripting" title="Scripting">
    scripts
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <a name="Models">
  </a>
  <h4>
   Models
  </h4>
  <p>
   Objects that are too complex to create with brushes or patches can be
   <a href="Modelling" title="Modelling">
    modelled
   </a>
   in an external application and imported into Doom 3, in either .
   <a href="ASE_%28file_format%29" title="ASE (file format)">
    ASE
   </a>
   or .
   <a href="LWO_%28file_format%29" title="LWO (file format)">
    LWO
   </a>
   file formats as an entity. A static model can be used to represent anything from a key to a table to a large stone buttress, while an animated model is required for enemies, monsters or NPCs.
  </p>
  <p>
   And despite the debate, models cannot be scaled by the engine. It is possible to scale them by carefully tweaking the rotation key/value pair, however the effect is only visual. The collision model does not scale with it.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unreal users will be accustomed to creating almost all architectural detail with static models, due to problems caused by excessively-complex BSP geometry. This is not an issue for Doom 3, which uses a unified rendering model that makes no distinction between BSP and model-based polygons. See the
   <a href="Modelling" title="Modelling">
    modelling
   </a>
   section for more discussion of the model vs brush distinction. Although entities by default, with the inline flag a model entity that is not supposed to be dynamic can be turned into map geometry when the map is compiled.
  </p>
  <a name="Patches">
  </a>
  <h3>
   Patches
  </h3>
  <p>
   <a href="Patch" title="Patch">
    Patches
   </a>
   are used to add rounded, curved or undulating surfaces to a map, which are not possible using brushes alone. They are defined using
   <i>
    Bezier curves
   </i>
   , and are smooth-shaded by the renderer.
  </p>
  <a name="Compiling_the_map">
  </a>
  <h2>
   Compiling the map
  </h2>
  <p>
   Before you can play a map you have to compile it. The easiest way is to select BSP &gt; BSP in the map editor, but you can also type "
   <a href="Dmap_%28console_command%29" title="Dmap (console command)">
    dmap
   </a>
   &lt;mymap&gt;" in the console. Doom 3 is different from previous id engines because it reads direct from .
   <a href="MAP_%28file_format%29" title="MAP (file format)">
    MAP
   </a>
   files without making computations for VIS and LIGHT, which are performed on-the-fly by the engine. However, you still need to 'compile' your maps to create a .
   <a href="CM_%28file_format%29" title="CM (file format)">
    CM
   </a>
   and a .
   <a href="PROC_%28file_format%29" title="PROC (file format)">
    PROC
   </a>
   which essentially makes solid geometry solid. Despite this, map compilation is very fast (measured in seconds).

  .CM files store collision model data. Collision models are a

  They are most commonly used with maps but can also be used with moveable physics objects.

  The creation of a collision model for use with a map is done automatically by the engine upon compile with the

  console command.
 </p>
 <p>
  To create a collision model for use with a moveable physics object, from within the level editor, you must select the brushes and/or model. Then click
  <b>
   Selection &gt; Export &gt; to CM
  </b>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  From this point the .CM file must be named and placed in the same directory as the map or model.

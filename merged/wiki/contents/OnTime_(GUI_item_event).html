   Called after a certain time has passed, since after the GUI has been activated. With this event, it's possible to create complex sequential animations, simulating a timeline. Several different onTime blocks can be used on the same item.

   <a href="ResetTime_%28GUI_command%29" title="ResetTime (GUI command)">
    resetTime
   </a>
   command, so complex animations can be controlled independently.

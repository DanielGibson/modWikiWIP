   A vector is a mathematical quantity having both
   <i>
    magnitude
   </i>
   and
   <i>
    direction
   </i>
   .  Common examples of quantities with only magnitude are mass(200kg), temperature(273 degrees Kelvin), and speed (15m/s) (not to be confused with velocity).  These are also referred to as
   <i>
    scalar quantities
   </i>
   , because they are described with magnitude only.
   <i>
    Vector quantities
   </i>
   are those which are described with both magnitude
   <i>
    and
   </i>
   direction.  Common examples are velocity (15m/s northeast) and force (150nt at 45 degrees).

   A 2d vector
   <b>
    a
   </b>
   can be desribed by the equation:
  </p>
  <pre> a = <b>i</b>x + <b>j</b>y
</pre>
  <p>
   Where
   <b>
    i
   </b>
   is the magnitude of the component in the x plane, and
   <b>
    j
   </b>
   of the y plane.
  </p>
  <p>
   A 3d vector is described in the same manner, but with 3 components:
  </p>
  <pre> a = <b>i</b>x + <b>j</b>y + <b>k</b>z
</pre>
  <p>
   With
   <b>
    k
   </b>
   being the magnitude of the z-plane component.
  </p>
  <p>
   These three components combine to form a vector, representing all three components.  For example, for a vector with the equation:
  </p>
  <pre> a = 1 + 2x + -3z
</pre>
  <p>
   The vector could be represented as a ray from the origin (0,0,0) through the point comprised of those three components. (1,2,-3)
  </p>
  <p>
   The magnitude (also called
   <i>
    modulus
   </i>
   )
   <b>
    |a|
   </b>
   of the new
   <i>
    resultant
   </i>
   vector can be found using the Pythagorean Theorem:
  </p>
  <pre> |a|² = x² + y² + z²
 |a|  = √(x² + y² + z²)
</pre>
  <p>
   <i>
    Normalizing
   </i>
   a vector will result in a
   <i>
    normal
   </i>
   (or
   <i>
    unit
   </i>
   ) vector, where the magnitude of the vector is equal to 1.  This, in effect, describes only the
   <i>
    direction
   </i>
   of the vector.
  </p>
  <p>
   To find a normalized vector
   <b>
    â
   </b>
   of vector
   <b>
    a
   </b>
   , divide the vector by it's modulus:
  </p>
  <pre>       a
 â =  ---
      |a|
</pre>
  <p>
   Or
  </p>
  <pre>        x
 â.x = ---
       |a|
</pre>
  <p>
   And so on for y,z,etc.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since a normalized vector has length of 1,
  </p>
  <pre> √(â.x² + â.y² + â.z²) = |â| = 1
</pre>

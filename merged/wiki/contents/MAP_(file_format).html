  The MAP file is an ASCII text type of files used by
  <a href="DoomEdit" title="DoomEdit">
   DoomEdit
  </a>
  to store individual game levels. This file has all the static geometry and entities. Before a level can be played it has to be compiled. See the
  <a href="Mapping" title="Mapping">
   mapping
  </a>
  section for more information on handling map files.

 <h2>
  Map Format Syntax
 </h2>
 <p>
  Generally, MAPs consist of entities. Some are called 'brushwork entities' for the obvious fact that they contain brush definitions.
 </p>
 <a name="Comments">
 </a>
 <h3>
  Comments
 </h3>
 <p>
  The MAP file format supports in-line comments. Comment blocks are not supported.
 </p>
 <p>
  To start a comment, place two forward slashes. ( '//' ) Everything behind these markers is ignored.
 </p>
 <a name="Header">
 </a>
 <h3>
  Header
 </h3>
 <p>
  The first non-empty/non-comment line contains the header, which currently consists of nothing more than the version.
 </p>
 <p>
  For Doom 3, the header is:
 </p>
 <pre>Version 2
</pre>
 <a name="Entities">
 </a>
 <h3>
  Entities
 </h3>
 <p>
  An entity definition starts by a curly open brace, ( '{' ) and runs on till a matching curly closing brace is found. ( '}' )
 </p>
 <p>
  The next lines contain the entity's key/value pairs. First comes the name, then the value. Both are enclosed in double quotes, with a space in between.
 </p>
 <p>
  After those keys and values, one or more brush definitions may follow.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  An entity should at least have a "spawnclass" key, otherwise unpredictable behaviour might occur.
 </p>
 <p>
  <b>
   Note:
  </b>
  The first entity should have a "spawnclass" key with value "worldspawn". Brush definitions which don't need to be in a seperate entity should be placed in this entity. There can only be
  <b>
   one
  </b>
  entity with this spawnclass in a whole MAP file.
 </p>
 <a name="Brush_definition">
 </a>
 <h4>
  Brush definition
 </h4>
 <p>
  A brush definition starts and ends with curly braces, just like entities do.
 </p>
 <pre>
// brush x
{
type
{
... type data, see type-specific section

}
}</pre>
 <p>
  <br/>
  Before each brush definition is mostly a comment line with the brush number, although this is not required as it is used by the editor only.
 </p>
 <p>
  The first line of the brush definition specifies the type of brush. In Doom 3, this is currently
  <b>
   brushDef3
  </b>
  for brush volumes or
  <b>
   patchDef2
  </b>
  for patches.
 </p>
 <p>
  <br/>
  After the type, the actual data follows - once more bounded by curly braces.
 </p>
 <a name="Brush_Volume_definition">
 </a>
 <h5>
  Brush Volume definition
 </h5>
 <p>
  A brush volume is a convex primitive defined by infinite planes. Because of this, it must have at least four sides although it usually has six.
 </p>
 <p>
  The data consists of multiple lines, one for each plane defining the volume:
 </p>
 <pre>(plane equation) ( ( xxscale xyscale xoffset ) ( yxscale yyscale yoffset ) ) "<a href="Material_%28decl%29" title="Material (decl)">material</a>"Â ?
</pre>
 <p>
  The 4 numbers forming the plane equation are nothing more than the normal vector of the plane and it's Euclidean (shortest) distance to the origin.
 </p>
 <p>
  The next 6 numbers are used to store the texture mapping. Each group of 3 numbers is actually a row in a 3x3 matrix where the bottom row is always '0 0 1'. In the code, it is referred to as a "texture matrix". Such a matrix is commonly used in geometry to transform a 2D coordinate vector (with the Z value set to 1) to another coordinate system.
 </p>
 <p>
  At the place of the question mark, extra numbers may or may not show up. It is unknown what they do, though it could be a mistake of the editor or some obscure feature. (More proof is needed to verify their use.)
 </p>
 <a name="Patch_definition">

 <h5>
  Patch definition
 </h5>
 <p>
  The patches used in the id Tech 4 engine are Bezier surfaces. These surfaces are defined by both
  <i>
   data points
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   control points
  </i>
  . Data points are points which are always part of the surface and thus influence the surface directly. Control points merely "attract" the surface towards them but offers a finer control in this way. The exact theory used for these surfaces is explained on sites dealing with Bezier mathematics, see
  <a href="MAP_%28file_format%29#External_links" title="">
   External links
  </a>
  for more info.
 </p>
 <p>
  The data for a patch definition consists of several things. First are these two lines:
 </p>
 <pre> "<a href="Material_%28decl%29" title="Material (decl)">material</a>"
 ( xoffset yoffset rotation xscale yscale )
</pre>
 <p>
  The first line specifies the material to apply to it, and the second specifies the texture settings with 5 those numbers.
 </p>
 <p>
  After that follows a matrix of points to define the control grid. The first and last line consist of an opening respectively closing brace. The rows are bounded with braces as well.
 </p>
 <p>
  For a 3 x 3 patch: (4 data points, 5 control points)
 </p>
 <pre>(
( ( x1 y1 z1 u1 v1 ) ( x2 y2 z2 u2 v2 ) ( x3 y3 z3 u3 v3 ) )
( ( x4 y4 z4 u4 v4 ) ( x5 y5 z5 u5 v5 ) ( x6 y6 z6 u6 v6 ) )
( ( x7 y7 z7 u7 v7 ) ( x8 y8 z8 u8 v8 ) ( x9 y9 z9 u9 v9 ) )
)</pre>
 <p>
  Each point has 5 coordinates where the first 3 are the 3D coordinates, the last 2 are the Bezier "blossom" coordinates. (Again, check the theory.)

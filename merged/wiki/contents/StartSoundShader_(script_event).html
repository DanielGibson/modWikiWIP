 <h2>
  Notes
 </h2>
 <p>
  This script event does not return any values.
 </p>
 <p>
  This is not the prefered method of playing a sound since you must ensure that the sound is loaded.
 </p>
 <p>
  -1st param (string shaderName)
 </p>
 <p>
  The shadernames are defined within sound shader files (typically .sndshd files) which are placed within base/sound/ (the doom3 game ones are found in pak003.pk3/sound). No path is necessary for the shadernames located directly in the sound directory.
 </p>
 <p>
  -2nd param (float channel)
Choose one of the possible channels as defined by doom_defs.script:
 </p>
 <pre>#define SND_CHANNEL_ANY     0
#define SND_CHANNEL_VOICE   1
#define SND_CHANNEL_VOICE2  2
#define SND_CHANNEL_BODY    3
#define SND_CHANNEL_BODY2   4
#define SND_CHANNEL_BODY3   5
#define SND_CHANNEL_WEAPON  6
#define SND_CHANNEL_ITEM    7
#define SND_CHANNEL_HEART   8
#define SND_CHANNEL_PDA     9
#define SND_CHANNEL_DEMONIC 10
</pre>
 <p>
  If there is already a sound clip playing from the entity on the channel you choose, it will be cut off and replaced by the new one you specified in the 1st parameter.
A special case is with SND_CHANNEL_ANY. Use of this channel seems to cause the sound to be played on any free channel.
 </p>
 <p>
  You should use the function
  <a class="new" href="CacheSoundShader_%28script_command%29sys.cacheSoundShader%28%29" title="CacheSoundShader (script command)sys.cacheSoundShader()">
   cacheSoundShader (script command)sys.cacheSoundShader()
  </a>
  to cache each sound shader you wish to use. It seems to play the sound regardless, but unless you precache it when the map loads, you could get some glitches.
 </p>
 <p>
  It seems that this can be called from any entity - including moving ones. Of course with a speaker entity you can set options such as volume, looping and occlusion. I cannot find a way of scripting these things.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can use
  <a class="new" href="StopSound_%28script_command%29" title="StopSound (script command)">
   entity.stopSound()
  </a>
  to stop a sound.

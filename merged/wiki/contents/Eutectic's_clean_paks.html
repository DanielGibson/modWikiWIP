  Doom 3 comes with a lot of redundant, incomplete or malfunctioning
  <a href="Declarations" title="Declarations">
   decl files
  </a>
  leading modders to wade through many assets which shouldn't be there. Eutectic's clean packs override these broken declarations by commenting them out.

  <b>
   IMPORTANT NOTE
  </b>
  : These packs were made for DOOM 3 version 1.1. They still
work with the latest version BUT THEY DO NOT WORK WITH THE RESURRECTION
OF EVIL EXPANSION PACK!
 </p>
 <p>
  It should also be mentioned that as these packs override various declarations, they can cause adverse effects while running the game. Therefore, it is wise to only use these packs while level editing and not while playing the game or testing a map or mod.

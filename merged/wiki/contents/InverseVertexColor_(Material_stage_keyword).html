  The
  <i>

  Example

 <p>
  The following stage will take the inverse of the vertex color of the mesh into account...
 </p>
 <pre>{
 map           textures/custom/image1
 inverseVertexColor
}

 <p>
  This keyword uses color math where...
 </p>
 <pre>[Image Map] x (1.0 - [Vertex Color]) = [Result]
</pre>
 <p>
  So for each texel across the surface of a mesh, the color of the image map and vertex color are sampled and then a result is calculated.
 </p>
 <p>
  So using the above formula here are some examples...
 </p>
 <pre>1.0 x (1.0 - 1.0)  = 0.0
1.0 x (1.0 - 0.75) = 0.25
1.0 x (1.0 - 0.5)  = 0.5
0.5 x (1.0 - 1.0)  = 0.0
0.5 x (1.0 - 0.75) = 0.03125
0.5 x (1.0 - 0.5)  = 0.25
</pre>
 <p>
  Generally speaking, as the vertex color shifts from black to white, the image map will darken. If the vertex color is black, result is the same as the image map. If the vertex color is white, the result is black.
 </p>
 <p>
  This keyword is commonly used in conjunction with VertexColor to create a material that blends between two textures based on vertex color. A very basic example would be like so...
 </p>
 <pre>{
 blend         add
 map           textures/custom/image1
 vertexColor
}
{
 blend         add
 map           textures/custom/image2
 inverseVertexColor
}
</pre>

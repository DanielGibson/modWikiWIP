  <p>
   The
   <b>
    alphaTest
   </b>
   stage keyword makes parts of a diffuse map texture invisible depending on the alpha channel. If the alpha value of a pixel is less than the threshold given as the parameter to alphaTest, that pixel will not be drawn.
  </p>
  <p>
   This is useful for rendering grids, gratings and so on, where parts of the texture must be transparent. It does
   <i>
    not
   </i>
   permit partial transparency of diffusemap textures.

   This is the only way for a diffuse stage to make use of alpha transparency.
  </p>
  <p>
   The only other blend mode that allows for alpha transparency is blend and it does not recieve lighting.
  </p>
  <p>
   Unfortunately alphatest is limited in that each pixel is either 100% opaque, or 100% transparent.

  <p>
   While alphaTest is a stage specific keyword, it has an effect on all stages. To counter that, use the  keyword
   <a href="IgnoreAlphaTest_%28Material_stage_keyword%29" title="IgnoreAlphaTest (Material stage keyword)">
    ignoreAlphaTest
   </a>
   in stages where you do not want to apply the alphaTest.

   Photoshop 7 does not save transparency information into an alpha channel when dealing with targa images. You must download the updated

   from

   </a>
   . All other versions of Photoshop work correctly.

   Applying an alphatested material to a brush will make it so that the brush cannot be used to seal off the map from the void. This can be noticed when the pointfile line goes straight through a brush.

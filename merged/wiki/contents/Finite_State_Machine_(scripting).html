   In terms of scripting, a Finite State Machine, or FSM, is a method of organising code into different behaviors or states.
  </p>
  <p>
   For script objects it's used to manage run time behavior, logic that runs for the lifetime of an entity, by breaking it into states.
  </p>
  <p>
   Implementation wise the spawn class manages it's script object thread by rerunning the current state each frame (providing the thread hasn't been told to wait). Setting a new state simply passes the name of a script function declared to be the next state.
  </p>
  <p>
   Various spawn classes have their own flavors of FSMs:
  </p>
  <p>
   idWeapon - used to manage weapon states.
  </p>
  <p>
   idActor - Has two FSMs, one for animation states, the other general purpose, which was used for AI states.
  </p>
  <p>
   Since the form of FSM in the scripting system is very simple, it's possible to manually create a similar system in a script object for entities that do not support a FSM in their spawn class.
  </p>
  <p>
   Quake 4 removed a lot of script events and created an expanded FSM for managing threads in game code.

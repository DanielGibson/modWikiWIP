  Plays a sound on the player (client) machine.

  This seems to be just a shortcut to the
  <a href="Set_%28GUI_command%29" title="Set (GUI command)">
   set command
  </a>
  using
  <i>
   cmd
  </i>
  and
  <i>
   play
  </i>
  parameters. If I had to guess, I'd say this command was added later in development on the Doom 3 engine, as id Software seems to use the set version most of the times instead.

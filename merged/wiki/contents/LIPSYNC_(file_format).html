  there is reason to believe that a built-in editor was available for creating these .lipsync files. At present, it is not known what console command is responcible for launching it.
 </p>
 <p>
  However, it is known that the editor is not functional due to a missing file (annosoft.dll).
 </p>
 <p>
  Unfortunately, due to liscencing issues, Raven is unable to release the lipsync SDK (including annosoft.dll) to the public. Of course, without the nessicary file the editor remains useless to the modding community.
 </p>
 <p>
  At present, there is no known alternative to the editor. However, it is still possible to create the files manually in a text editor.

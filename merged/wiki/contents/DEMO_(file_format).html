  These files are recordings usually done for benchmark purposes, they can have live gameplay or static scenes and are stored in /
  <a href="Demos_%28folder%29" title="Demos (folder)">
   demos
  </a>
  . Even after the introduction of LZW compression in v1.3 they remain big files. These files are created with two console commands:
  <a href="DemoShot_%28console_command%29" title="DemoShot (console command)">
   demoShot
  </a>
  for static scenes and
  <a href="RecordDemo_%28console_command%29" title="RecordDemo (console command)">
   recordDemo
  </a>
  for rolling demos. Use the
  <a class="new" href="StopRecording_%28console_command%29" title="StopRecording (console command)">
   stopRecording
  </a>
  console command to stop a the recording of a rolling demo.
 </p>
 <p>
  You can playback demos with the
  <a class="new" href="PlayDemo_%28console_command%29" title="PlayDemo (console command)">
   playDemo
  </a>
  console command (it works on both types of demos). If you wish to benchmark using a demo see the
  <a href="TimeDemo_%28console_command%29" title="TimeDemo (console command)">
   timeDemo
  </a>
  and
  <a class="new" href="TimeDemoQuit_%28console_command%29" title="TimeDemoQuit (console command)">
   timeDemoQuit
  </a>
  console commands (you should set "
  <a href="Com_compressDemos_%28cvar%29" title="Com compressDemos (cvar)">
   com_compressDemos
  </a>
  0" in the console to avoid any slowdowns during the benchmark due to decompression).

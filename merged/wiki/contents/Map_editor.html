   There are several views available while editing and creating levels using the map editor. The main view orientations are as follows:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    X/Y (Top, or birds-eye view)
   </li>
   <li>
    X/Z (Front view)

   <li>
    Cam (3D view)

   This inspector is divided into two main areas: the top one serves as an assets explorer breaking down assets through their relative paths in their
   <a href="Declarations" title="Declarations">
    declarations
   </a>
   files. The two icons in this area are the folder and the file. Selecting a file will automatically load it into memory (for instance, if it's a texture it will become available in the texture inspector, see below). You can also load more than one asset at a time by double clicking on its parent folder; this action will load all assets in that folder and subfolders into memory. The "reload" button on top serves to reload all the declaration files again, because of a bug in the map editor you need to click the button for the inspector to load model assets. If you right click a selected asset a context menu will appear; this menu does not function properly and will crash the editor.
  </p>
  <p>
   The bottom part of the inspector is the preview window. The four coloured lines represent the red, green, blue and alpha components of
   <a href="Images" title="Images">

   but this feature has no effect. You can use the left and right mouse buttons to rotate and move the asset selected, respectively. For some assets like textures and guis the rotation feature is unavailable. To access the media inspector you can also use

   This inspector will list all the textures which are loaded into memory and available to be applied to elements of your map. Textures are loaded either automatically by loading a map and by using the media inspector. To access the texture inspector you can also use

   </p>
  </p>
  <p>
   On the left you can choose between point and projected lights. A point light will affect everything inside the purple coloured parallelopiped while a projected light normally uses a pyramid. Simply put, a point light is like the Sun while projected lights behave like spotlights.
  </p>
  <p>
   In the point light options, the "equilateral radius" setting locks the radius settings for all three axis into the same value and always get a cube-like volume. These three control the size of the purple box. The "fall-off" radio buttons don't appear to do anything; whilst the "parallel" setting will make the light appear to be infinitely far away casting all the shadows in the same direction, simulating the Sun. If you enable the "centre" option the three text boxes on its right will become active and a small purple dot will appear in the editing window. This centre refers to the origin of the light and shadows. Usually this is the same as the origin of the affected volume but by enabling this option you can make the volume light up one area while the centre of the light is in another. You can change this centre by either dragging the purple dot in the editor view or by inserting its actual origin values here.
  </p>
  <p>
   When you select "projected light" a second set of options becomes available while the above are disabled. The light's volume will also change to a square pyramid with two purple dots. The nine-cell matrix controls this new volume but it's easier to do it in the editor view window by dragging the purple dots around. If you enable the "explicit start/end points" options the volume is capped somewhere before the light's origin and two green dots appear. You can also control the cap in the text boxes but it's easier to drag the green control dots.
  </p>
  <p>
   The options on the right apply to both types of light. The three options on top control optimisations you can enable. Please note that these can be overridden by the actual
   <a href="Material_%28decl%29" title="Material (decl)">
    texture
   </a>
   you might choose below.
  </p>
  <p>
   The colour button allows you to pick a particular colour for the light from a palette. Finally, you can choose a specific material in the "texture" dropdown list. These will modulate the light and light volume and while some will respect the colour you pick in the palette others will override that.

  <p>
   This is where you can modify the texturing (and complexity in case of a
   <a href="Patch" title="Patch">
    patch
   </a>
   ) of a particular surface. The textbox on top shows the material of the currently selected surface. The following two dials allow you to shift a texture x units in any direction while the "rotate" one allows you to rotate the texture around a rotating axis located in the centre of the surface.
  </p>
  <p>
   Next come the scaling options that allow you stretch or shrink a texture in a particular direction. Enabling the "absolute" option makes any values on the right boxes ignore any previous scaling values.
  </p>
  <p>
   The "fit" button scales the texture enough to fit the particular surface perfectly. The "width" and "height" values control how many times a texture should fit in that surface. The "cap" button is most useful for aligning textures in capped patches while "natural" will revert all scaling/rotation changes to that surface. The two flip buttons allows you to mirror a texture along the respective axis.
  </p>
  <p>
   Finally if you are selecting a patch and enable the "subdivide patch" option you can then control how complex that patch is with the slider. More subdivisions means higher quality but lower performance.

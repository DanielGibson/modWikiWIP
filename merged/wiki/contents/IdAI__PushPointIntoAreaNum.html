   If the point is already in the specified area, it does nothing, 
otherwise it 'pushes' the point into the area by moving it along the surface normal of all the planes 
that make up the area. Imagine if an area were a box and the point were outside the bottom right side of the box, 
it would first push the point along the right normal so it would be below the box, 
then it would push the point along the bottom normal so it would be inside the box.

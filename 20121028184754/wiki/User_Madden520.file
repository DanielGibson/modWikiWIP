<p>What Is The Best Brand Of Mattress?<br /><br />When you are buying a new mattress, one of the key things you would want to look for is a good brand. The brand alone can clue you up as to the real durability and quality of the mattress you are buying. This is probably why many mattress manufacturing companies are struggling to be known in the mattress industry.
When it comes to the best brand of mattress, you can't find one brand that will eclipse other brands. We all have varying opinions as to the best brand of mattress that can provide our body with a good kind of sleep. But to appease curiosity, I checked out some of the highly-rated ones.
Innerspring Mattresses
When it comes to innerspring beds, perhaps the most popular of them all is Sealy. In the past few decades, Sealy has been competing with Simmons and Serta. But it wasn't until lately that they were regarded as the biggest mattress manufacturing company. The mattress industry is practically benchmarked by Sealy.
Amongst their list of mattress options, the most popular ones are their innerspring beds. They are known for their durability and their comfort.
Memory Foam Mattress
Crafting memory foams is the expertise of Tempurpedic. They have adopted the visco elastic foam technology of NASA. This company is famous because their Tempur material. They take pride in the fact that their Tempur material is different from the other foams out in the market. This material provides consistent comfort and support to the users. It also helps alleviate pressure points and corrects spinal posture.
Latex Foam Mattress
Arguably the best latex mattress brand today is Englander. They specialize in breathable latex foam beds. They are also quite popular because of the natural structure of their mattresses. Latex is a good choice if you are looking for a mattress that can ward off bacteria, germs, molds and other micro organisms.
Air Mattress
For camping beds, Coleman is the authority. They do have a lot of highly-rated camping beds that can be inflated easily. But if you are looking for a primary air bed, you can try Comfortaire. Theirs have a more modern technology. They use a special kind of Sleep Number system to determine the right level of comfort that your body needs.
When you are looking for a reliable mattress brand, make sure they have already built a reputation in this industry. They couldn't have stayed long in the market if their products are not reliable.
